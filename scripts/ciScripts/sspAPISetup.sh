# *** SSP Insert Static Reference Content into SSP Training Script ***
#
# This script inserts static reference content that is referenced by students and coaches
#  into a postgres SSP database. It does so by calling a psql command on database 'ssp' 
#  that loads a sql file and inserts it into the database. 
#
# Params: 1st OPTIONAL arg number=1 to tell script to output to file 
#	 	instead of the db. File is set to 
#           ../postgres/sspTrainingDataCompiled(TODAY'S DATE).sql
#
#
# Note: Requires Postgres 8.X or higher (SQL Script Dependency)
#
