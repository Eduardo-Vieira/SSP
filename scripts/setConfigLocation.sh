# This script is only needed in a development environment for setting the environment
# variable that has the location of the test configuration directory for your console.
# Usage scenarios:  before running mvn, or in tomcat startup script
#
# This is the unix version of the script.  It has been tested with bash.
#
# Optionally, you can simply set the environment variable below in your global
# environment instead of having to run it in each console.

export SSP_CONFIGDIR=/usr/local/etc/ssp
export SSP_TESTCONFIGDIR=/usr/local/etc/ssp
