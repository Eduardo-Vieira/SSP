This document will walk through the general process of creating an environment to run SSP in a production environment.

Required:
 - Database Server         - PostgreSQL 8 or greater suggested  (will support MS-SQL in future release)
 - Java Application Server - Apache Tomcat 6 suggested
  
Installing PostgreSQL (http://www.postgresql.org/)
  On Unix:
    - PostgreSQL is available in the package manager of most linux distributions.  
      Install it according to the distributions instructions.
        Ubuntu - https://help.ubuntu.com/11.10/serverguide/C/postgresql.html
  On Mac:
    - PostgreSQL is available via the homebrew package manager or as a download on 
      the postgresql.org site.
  On Windows:
    - PostgreSQL is available as a download on the postgresql.org site.
  
Configure PostgreSQL
  Connect with pgadmin or your preferred db admin tool and create the "ssp" & 
  "sspadmin" users and the "ssp" database.
  
  
Installing Apache Tomcat 6
  On Unix:
    - Tomcat is available in the package manager of most linux distributions.  
      Install it according to the distributions instructions.
        Ubuntu - https://help.ubuntu.com/11.10/serverguide/C/tomcat.html
  On Mac:
    - Tomcat is available via the homebrew package manager or as a download at:  
      http://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi
  On Windows:
    - Tomcat is available as a download at: http://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi
  
Configure SSP
  On Unix/Mac:
    - Create a directory at /usr/local/etc/ssp
    - Make it only readable by the user that is running tomcat
  On Windows:
    - Create a directory at C:\ssp\
    - Make it only readable by the user that is running tomcat
    - In the next step, be sure to use Windows paths formatted in Java
    - There is a context.xml file that is put into the conf directory of tomcat 
      once the application starts.  Or you can paste it there ahead of time.  
      It is available from this project in src/main/webapp/META-INF/context.xml
      The destination path is $CATALINA_HOME/conf/context.xml
  After Above on Unix/Mac/Windows:
    - copy the files from this project in src/main/config/external to /usr/local/etc/ssp or C:\ssp\
    - Review each file carefully to set the appropriate settings.
    - Add the following environment variables to your system, and point
      them to the appropriate external configuration path:
      - On Unix/Mac:
      	- SSP_CONFIGDIR=/usr/local/etc/ssp
      - On Windows:
      	- SSP_CONFIGDIR=C:\ssp\
    
Deploy SSP
  - Right now the deployment file is not available anywhere, so it must be 
    generated with maven.  Look at the DevelopmentEnvironmentSetup.txt for instructions.
  - Once you have the war file, you'll need to drop it into the webapps directory of tomcat
  - Double check your settings in the config directory.
  - Start Tomcat according to the manner specified by your Operating System.
