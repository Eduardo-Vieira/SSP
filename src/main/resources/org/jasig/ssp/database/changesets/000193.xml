The term range for a given calculation will start with the oldest term for the student's planned courses up to the cutoff term.
The term code set here must be a valid term from external_term.
If blank, invalid, or it doesn't match term code in external_term, the term with the latest start date having a registration window overlapping the current date will be used.
Or, if no terms have an open registration window, the current term will be used."></column>
