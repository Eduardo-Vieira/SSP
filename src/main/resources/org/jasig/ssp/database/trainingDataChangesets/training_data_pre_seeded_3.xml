    <!-- Some of the training data has journal_entry records with non-null
    journal_track_id values, but no corresponding record in
    journal_entry_detail, which would normally specify the actually selected
    step/step-detail associations. The UI does not expect this state. So we
    wipe the tracks from these entries, but make sure the latter have
    comments so the UI will validate by default. -->
