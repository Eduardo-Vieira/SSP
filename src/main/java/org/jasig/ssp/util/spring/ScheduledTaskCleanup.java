/**
 * Ensures the task scheduler and executor are shutdown prior to
 * "normal" app context cleanup. We need this because a race
 * condition exists where a currently executing job on a background
 * thread can request a bean dependency (e.g. when a
 * {@code @Transactional} method unwinds) after the bean factory
 * has destroyed all singletons. If that destruction has completed
 * there are no further protections against bean creation. This can
 * then manifest as problems such as re-acquisition of the Liquibase
 * lock, which might not then be released if the (usually daemon)
 * worker threads subsequently terminate unceremoniously. This was
 * reported as
 * <a href="https://issues.jasig.org/browse/SSP-1273">SSP-1273</a>.
 *
 * <p>This workaround is a slightly modified version of the workaround
 * described in a StackOverflow
 * <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6603443">answer</a>.</p>
 *
 * <p>Decided this was a better approach than playing games with either
 * bean definition ordering or the {@code depends-on} attribute. The
 * latter might eventually make sense even if just to ensure a
 * more sane startup order, but prevents the use of XML-namespaced
 * configuration shortcuts.</p>
